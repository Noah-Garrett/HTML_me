     <p class="arial textcard"> Apple has introduced their latest iteration of the Macbook line.
         Touting several impressive upgrades this year, apple as finally shown renewed
         interest in amping up the game in their laptop line; a decision that wasn't so
         obvious during their iPadOS release days.<br>
         First, let's cover the other upgrades. although none of them are game changers,
        they do display apple's aptitude to designing a consumer focused product.
        Featuring a bigger display thanks to its 34% smaller bezels, a 100wh battery
        (the biggest allowed on commercial us flights), and improved microphone, big size
        translates to big creature comfort.
        <article class="arial">
            <p>the new display isn't just bigger, it's better. Running 226 ppi at 3,072 x 1,920 resolutionâ€”that's 
                slightly higher than the 2,880 x 1,800 resolution and 220 ppi of the 15-inch MacBook Pro.
                Apple reports it's the best display on a Macbook yet, and I don't think they're lying.

                All that is good news (except the touch bar is still there) but there's the biggest,
                best news of all. Say goodbye to the old keyboard! Since 2015 Apple users have been fighting
                with their sore fingers over their "ingeniously" designed keys. They were flat with a crazy short
                travel and a CRAZY high propinquity for getting stuck.<br>

                Seriously, it was a problem. a BIG problem. Apple attempted to fix the issue by adding
                an additional rubber membrane, but it did little to stop the dirt. What it DID do was bring
                the noise, with many users saying the new keyboards are just too loud. The keys were so 
                short that traditional methods of cleaning keys - compressed air or toothbrush bristles - 
                failed to aleviate the crunchy disaster. Plus, their compact snack size meant removing
                the keys was that much harder; although not impossible.<br>

                Well it appears the answer was in front of us all along; if you can't go forwards,
                go backwards. The new keys are reportedly like their original 2015 designs.
                Im enjoying typing this right now on my 2012 Macbook pro. great travel, good key feel,
                and nobody in the coffee shop is putting on headphones because of me. It's honestly
                one of the best non-gaming laptop keyboards I've had the pleasure in using.
                and best of all, my fingers don't hurt.

                Was all this a little snarky? yes it was. But it comes from a place of love. Reinventing
                has gotten a lot harder in recent years; peak design is almost upon us, and deviating is 
                not only risky, but probably foolish. But sometimes you have to try - attempt an extreme
                and see what the outcome is. Phones keep getting bigger, when does it become " big"? 
                apple chose to see how flat a laptop can go; and we as a consumer have taught product 
                designers a lesson they only could have learned by trying; A bad keyboard makes a bad
                product.
